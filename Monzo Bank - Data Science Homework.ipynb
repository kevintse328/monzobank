    "Building off of the bag-of-words model suggested in the assignment, I used tf-idf and SVMs to predict the label of the chat message (specifically the tag1 field). Most of this code was adapted from scikit-learn's Working with Text page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Assume you cut the data set into 5 equal chunks. You train your model on 4 chunks (the “training set”) and evaluate its performance on the 1 chunk left out (the “validation set”). You then re-train your model on the other four combinations of training and validation sets and assess its performance over the five iterations. This prevents the model from “cheating” by testing its performance on data it has trained on already.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows two tables. The first is the precision/recall table on the **last** iteration. This gives a good look into the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second table is the confusion matrix. The columns represent the predicted labels while the rows represent the actual labels. This provides more granularity into what the model got right and wrong."

    "## How would you evaluate the model results? Which metrics would you use to judge whether your model is “good” or “bad”. Tip: there is tradeoff to be made.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "I evaluated the model’s performance by checking its precision and recall on specific tags and the dataset as a whole. Assume that in the data set, 10 chat messages were tagged with the label X. Assume that the model predicted 6 messages to have a label of X, but only 4 of those were actually X (true positives). Precision measures how many chat messages the model tagged as X were actually X (4/6) and is an indication of quality, while recall measures how many X messages did the model tag (4/10) and is an indication of completeness. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an inherent trade-off to both precision and recall. You can increase precision by decreasing the amount of messages the model tags as X, but that penalizes recall. Conversely, you can increase recall by tagging more messages as X, but the results will be less relevant and therefore less precise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although my model had more or less the same precision and recall across the dataset as a whole, individual labels would have wildly varying precision and recall, from heavily weighting recall for “TRAVEL - FX rates” messages to heavily weighting precision for “APP – Outage” messages. Given the precision-recall trade-off, I would weight precision more for the simple reason that to build trust in the model, it is better to tag fewer messages correctly than it is to make sure you tagged all relevant messages.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Given it’s a very simple model, do you see a way how it still might be useful? Maybe in parts? Are the resulting class probabilities useful in some way?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only looked at the F-score (the harmonic mean of recall and precision) to evaluate what tags the model is useful for, it’s clear that the model is only useful for certain tags. For example, with an F-score of 0.91, I would trust the model to correctly tag a message with “PIN - sent”. I would have less trust in the model when it tags a message with “APP – Outage”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Can you think of any potential issues with relying on such models?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data quality: The model is only as good as the data you give it. If you give it very noisy data, such as those tagged as \"APP – Outage\" (Appendix C), its performance will suffer.\n",
    "* Interpretability: It's difficult to explain to a layman why a model tagged a chat message a certain way. Depending on the context, interpretability may be crucial to adoption of a model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## How can this model be further improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Appendix B I've shown failed attempts to improve the model, namely centered around better data pre-processing such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* stripping out numbers\n",
    "* stemming words to reduce the vocabulary\n",
    "* SVM parameter optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible areas to explore include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding more features, such as user's phone operating system, time at which the chat message was sent, outage information during that time, etc. This is hinted at by the plateauing performance of the model as shown in Appendix A.\n",
    "* Switching algorithms (i.e. LSTM, word2vec)\n",
